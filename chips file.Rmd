# --- 1. Setup and Package Loading ---
# Run these installations once if you haven't already
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("skimr")
# install.packages("tinytex")
# tinytex::install_tinytex() # Run this after installing tinytex package

# Load necessary libraries for your analysis
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr) # For enhanced data summaries

# --- 2. Data Loading ---
# Make sure these CSV files are in the same directory as your R Markdown file
transaction_data <- read_csv("QVI_transaction_data.xlsx - in.csv")
purchase_behaviour <- read_csv("QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv")

# Optional: View first few rows of each dataset to confirm loading
# head(transaction_data)
# head(purchase_behaviour)

# --- 3. Initial Data Checks ---

# High-Level Summaries
glimpse(transaction_data)
glimpse(purchase_behaviour)

summary(transaction_data)
summary(purchase_behaviour)

skim(transaction_data) # Comprehensive summary
skim(purchase_behaviour)

# Check and Correct Data Formats
# Example: Convert DATE column to actual Date type if it's not already
# Adjust the format string if your date format is different (e.g., "%d/%m/%Y")
transaction_data <- transaction_data %>%
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))

# Check unique values for categorical columns to identify inconsistencies
transaction_data %>% distinct(PROD_NAME) %>% print(n = Inf) # Print all unique product names
purchase_behaviour %>% distinct(LIFESTAGE)
purchase_behaviour %>% distinct(PREMIUM_CUSTOMER)

# --- 4. Finding Outliers and Cleaning Data ---

# Example: Identify potential outliers in PROD_QTY (e.g., quantity = 200)
# A quantity of 200 is highly unusual for a single chip purchase and likely an error.
transaction_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = PROD_QTY)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of Product Quantity")

# Filter out the transaction with PROD_QTY of 200 (or any other identified outlier)
# You might need to adjust this filter based on your data exploration
transaction_data_cleaned <- transaction_data %>%
  filter(PROD_QTY < 100) # Assuming quantities over 100 are outliers for chips

# Verify filtering
# transaction_data_cleaned %>%
#   ggplot(aes(x = PROD_QTY)) +
#   geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "green", color = "black") +
#   ggtitle("Histogram of Product Quantity (Cleaned)")

# --- 5. Feature Engineering ---

# Derive PACK_SIZE from PROD_NAME
# Extracts the numeric value followed by 'g'
transaction_data_processed <- transaction_data_cleaned %>%
  mutate(PACK_SIZE = as.numeric(str_extract(PROD_NAME, "\\d+g")))

# Verify the new PACK_SIZE column
# transaction_data_processed %>%
#   distinct(PACK_SIZE) %>%
#   arrange(PACK_SIZE)

# Derive BRAND from PROD_NAME
# This is a basic extraction; you might need to refine this with more complex logic
# (e.g., specific rules for known brands if the initial word isn't always the brand)
transaction_data_processed <- transaction_data_processed %>%
  mutate(BRAND = str_extract(PROD_NAME, "^[A-Za-z]+"))

# Verify the new BRAND column
# transaction_data_processed %>%
#   distinct(BRAND) %>%
#   print(n = Inf) # Print all unique brands

# Combine transaction data with customer behaviour data
# Assuming L_CUSTOMER_ID is the common column
merged_data <- inner_join(transaction_data_processed, purchase_behaviour, by = "L_CUSTOMER_ID")

# View structure of merged data
# glimpse(merged_data)

# --- 6. Define Metrics of Interest and Perform Analysis by Segment ---

# Calculate key metrics grouped by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
customer_segment_summary <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Spend = sum(TOT_SALES),
    Avg_Spend_Per_Customer = sum(TOT_SALES) / n_distinct(L_CUSTOMER_ID), # Average spend by unique customer
    Total_Transactions = n(),
    Avg_Units_Per_Transaction = mean(PROD_QTY),
    Avg_Price_Per_Unit = mean(TOT_SALES / PROD_QTY, na.rm = TRUE),
    Unique_Customers = n_distinct(L_CUSTOMER_ID),
    .groups = 'drop' # Important to ungroup after summarise
  )

print(customer_segment_summary)

# Analyze preferred Pack Sizes by Segment
pack_size_by_segment <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, PACK_SIZE) %>%
  summarise(Sales = sum(TOT_SALES), .groups = 'drop_last') %>% # group_by for slice_head
  arrange(LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, desc(Sales)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3) # Get top 3 pack sizes per segment

print(pack_size_by_segment)

# Analyze preferred Brands by Segment
brand_by_segment <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, BRAND) %>%
  summarise(Sales = sum(TOT_SALES), .groups = 'drop_last') %>% # group_by for slice_head
  arrange(LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, desc(Sales)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3) # Get top 3 brands per segment

print(brand_by_segment)

# --- 7. Visualization Examples ---
# Use ggplot2 to visualize your findings

# Bar chart: Total Spend by Customer Lifestage and Premium Category
customer_segment_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = LIFESTAGE, y = Total_Spend, fill = PREMIUM_CUSTOMER)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +

       x = "Customer Lifestage", y = "Total Spend ($)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) # Rotate x-axis labels

# Bar chart: Average Spend Per Customer by Customer Lifestage and Premium Category

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Example: Visualize top brands by a specific segment (e.g., "OLDER FAMILIES" "Mainstream")
brand_by_segment %>%
  filter(LIFESTAGE == "OLDER FAMILIES", PREMIUM_CUSTOMER == "Mainstream") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(BRAND, Sales), y = Sales)) +

# Add more visualizations as needed based on your specific insights

# --- 8. Strategic Recommendation Section (Text in R Markdown) ---
# After your code chunks, you can write your strategic recommendations directly in R Markdown using headings, bullet points, etc.
# For example:

# ## Strategic Recommendations for Julia
#
# Based on the analysis of purchasing trends and behaviors, we propose the following strategic recommendations for the upcoming category review:
#
# ### Key Findings:
# * **Finding 1:** [State your first key finding from the data, e.g., "Older families (Mainstream) represent the highest total spenders in the chips category."]
# * **Finding 2:** [State your second key finding, e.g., "Young Singles/Couples (Budget) show a strong preference for 175g pack sizes of Doritos."]
#
# ### Actionable Recommendations:
# 1.  **Recommendation 1:** [Translate Finding 1 into an action, e.g., "Implement targeted promotions for larger pack sizes (e.g., 175g and 330g) specifically aimed at Older Families (Mainstream and Premium segments) through in-store displays and loyalty program offers."]
# 2.  **Recommendation 2:** [Translate Finding 2 into an action, e.g., "Increase shelf space and promotional activity for Doritos 175g packs in areas frequented by young demographics, particularly near universities or young professional hubs."]
# 3.  **Recommendation 3:** [Add further recommendations based on your analysis, focusing on commercial application.]
